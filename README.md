CowBook was created with the aim of helping farmers manage and identify the life history of their animals.
This application allows, through a QR code scanning system, to record incidents, treatments and important events in animals on a farm.
Our purpose is to help the farmer, through a low-cost solution, available to everyone, but taking care of the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
